This directory contains the files required to create a docker container running pgAdmin.

Building
========

Whilst you can just use the Dockerfile directly, it requires that various pre-configuration steps are performed, for
example, the pgAdmin web code must be copied to `./web`, Sphinx documentation source must be copied to `./docs`
and `requirements.txt` is also expected to be in this directory.

The recommended (and easy) way to build the container is to do:

```console
cd $PGADMIN_SRC/
workon pgadmin-venv
make docker
```

This will call the build script $PGADMIN_SRC/pkg/docker/build.sh which will prepare a staging directory containing all
the required files, then build the container and push it to your repo.

Running
=======

The container will accept the following variables at startup:

PGADMIN_SETUP_EMAIL
-------------------

This is the email address used when setting up the initial administrator account to login to pgAdmin.

PGADMIN_SETUP_PASSWORD
----------------------

This is the password used when setting up the initial administrator account to login to pgAdmin.

PGADMIN_ENABLE_TLS
------------------

Default: unset

If not set, the container will listen on port 8080 for connections in insecure HTTP protocol.
If set to any value, the container will listen on port 8443 for TLS connections.

When TLS is enabled, a certificate and key must be provided.
Typically these should be stored on the host file system and mounted from the container.
The expected paths are `/certs/server.crt` and `/certs/server.key`.

You need to explicitly map these ports with `-p` option to some port at your machine.

Examples
========

Run a simple container over port 80:

```console
docker run -p 80:8080 \
           -e "PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=hawq@pgadmin.org" \
           -e "PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=asdf1234" \
           -d pgadmin4
```

Run a TLS secured container using a shared config/storage directory in /private/var/lib/pgadmin on the host:

```console
docker run -p 443:8443 \
           -v "/private/var/lib/pgadmin:/var/lib/pgadmin" \
           -v "/path/to/certificate.cert:/certs/server.cert" \
           -v "/path/to/certificate.key:/certs/server.key" \
           -e "PGADMIN_SETUP_EMAIL=user@domain.com" \
           -e "PGADMIN_SETUP_PASSWORD=SuperSecret" \
           -e "PGADMIN_ENABLE_TLS=1" \
           -d pgadmin4
```
